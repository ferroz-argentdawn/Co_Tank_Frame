**Co-Tank Frame** is a lightweight, high-performance unit frame dedicated entirely to your tanking partner. Designed for modern raiding and mythic+, it ensures you never lose track of your co-tank’s health, power, or critical debuffs.

### Why use Co-Tank Frame?

In the heat of a boss encounter, standard raid frames can be cluttered and difficult to track for precise tank swaps. Co-Tank Frame provides a dedicated, movable, and scalable UI element that automatically finds and tracks your partner so you can focus on the fight.

### Key Features:

*   **Automatic Detection:** No setup required. The addon automatically identifies the other tank in your party or raid and binds them to the frame.
*   **Boss Debuff Tracking:** Built-in tracking for "Boss Aura" debuffs, ensuring you always see active stacks for tank-swap mechanics.
*   **Blizzard Edit Mode Integration:** Fully supports the modern WoW Edit Mode. Move, scale, and save your layout just like any other Blizzard UI element.
*   **Minimalist Design:** Features a clean, high-contrast look with class-colored health bars and power-type coloring (Rage, Mana, Energy, etc.).
*   **Performance First:** Built using secure templates to ensure zero "addon blocked" errors and virtually no impact on your framerate.

### Slash Commands:

*   `/cotank reset` — Resets the frame to the center of your screen.
*   `/cotank filter` — Toggles between showing all debufs and only showing what Blizard considers \*Eseential Encounter Debuffs\*
*   `/cotank test` — Resets the frame to the center of your screen.
